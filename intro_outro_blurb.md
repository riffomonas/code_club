I believe you can answer your own data analysis questions. Do you?

If you do, stick around for another edition of Code Club. I'm your host, Pat Schloss, and my goal is to help you to grow in confidence to ask and answer questions about the world around us using data

Running our farm is a lot of work. Every day we have a list of chores that we need to take care of to help the animals stay healthy and get to a size that we can market their meat. It's easy to get lost in the day to day activities. Something that forces us to remember the big picture is that with the exception of chickens, we breed our own animals to produce animals destined for meat and to produce more females so that we can replace aging animals and grow our farm. Knowing that there are pregnant animals on the farm helps us to remember to plan ahead. This takes planning! One year, we had two cows deliver calves in the middle of the night in the beginning of January. It was not a pleasant experience. Aside from avoiding animals that struggle with hypothermia, we also modify the diet of the moms to support the growth of the unborn animals and to make sure mom has sufficient milk production.

Each animal has its own gestation period where a piglet, lamb, or calf grows within its mother. A google search for "sheep gestation" will pull up a table that tells you the due date for when a ewe will lamb if you know when she was bred. These tables are easy enough to use, but if we are trying out different management scenarios, it might not be efficient as using something like R. So that's what we'll discuss today. We'll learn how to use functions from the lubridate package to figure out when animals are due and when they should be bred if we want them born on a certain date.

Let's go ahead and head over to the Code Club page for today, which is hosted on the Riffomonas website at riffomonas.org

Thanks again for joining me for this week's Code Club. Be sure that you spend time going through the exercises on your own to help reinforce your new skills. Even better would be for you to take the data and tools we've worked on today to answer your very own question!

I'd love to see what you did - please feel free to drop a line in the comments below to tell us what question you were eager to answer. Also, please let me know what types of data analysis questions you have and I'll do my best to answer them in a future Code Club.

Be sure to tell your friends about Code Club and to like this video, subscribe to the Riffomonas channel and click on the bell so you know when the next Code Club video drops every Thursday. Keep practicing and we'll see you next time for another Code Club
