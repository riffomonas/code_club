It is common to need to make muti-$$panel figures for scientific publications to have multiple panels. How would we make these types of figures in R? In this episode, Pat shares some of his own thinking as he iterates through using facet_wrap, facet_grid, and patchwork to show the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches with the same data. This episode is a bit different than Pat's other episodes and would love your feedback on this type of content!
