Pat recreates a horizontal stacked barplot from YouGov that shows people's preferences for different card games using the ggplot2 R package. The plot was generated using functions from the tidyverse including the dplyr, ggplot2, showtext, and ggtext packages. The functions he uses from these packages include aes, arrange, as.character, coord_cartesian, cumsum, element_blank, element_text, element_textbox_simple, font_add_google, geom_col, geom_text, ggplot, ggsave, labs, length, library, margin, mutate, nest, pivot_longer, pivot_wider, position_stack, scale_fill_manual, showtext_auto, showtext_opts, theme, tribble, unit, and unnest. The newsletter describing this visualization at a 30,000 ft view can be [found here](https://shop.riffomonas.org/posts/visualizing-how-americans-feel-about-different-card-games). You can find the original article describing the data [here](https://today.yougov.com/entertainment/articles/45795-how-americans-feel-about-30-card-games). The data are availble as a [PDF here](https://d3nkl3psvxxpe9.cloudfront.net/documents/crosstabs_Card_Games.pdf).

# 1. Get data from YouGov
#    * data clean up
#    * formatting data to "work":
#      * re-scale the numbers
#      * order of sentiments
#      * order of loving
# 2. Create horizontal stacked bar plot
# 3. Implement the color scheme for bars / format/place legend
# 4. Inserting numbers into bars
#    * remove values under 4%
#    * fix x-axis placement
#    * color the numbers accordingly
# 5. Titles

# 6. Other formatting
