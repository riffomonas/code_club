Did there seem to be more or less snow than normal last year in Michigan? How about where you live? In this Code Club, Pat shows you how you can use tools from the tidyverse like dplyr's `group_by` and `summarize` and joins, ggplot2's `geom_line`, `theme`, and scale functions, and ggtext's `element_markdown` functions to answer these and other important questions. He does all this using local weather data downloaded from NOAA in RStudio with a lot of help from the tidyverse
