There are some awesome integrations for developing R packages that leverage the power of GitHub actions. In this episode, Pat will show how we can test whether a package will build on other operating systems than the OS you are developing on. Then he will quantify the level of code coverage using the covr package and leverage Codecov and GitHub actions to make sure the coverage is calculated every time we push to the repository. The results of these GitHub actions will be included as new badges in the package's README file. This episode is part of an ongoing effort to develop an R package that implements the naive Bayesian classifier for classifying 16S rRNA gene sequences.
