A slope plot (or slope chart) is an effective visualization tool to compare the change in something between two time points. In this Code Club, Pat uses the ggplot2 R package to show two methods of generating a slope plot: using geom_segmet and geom_line. The data is taken from an Ipsos survey that found the percentage of people in 15 countries who said they were willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as of August and October of 2020.

Pat uses functions from the tidyverse including the `geom_line` and `geom_segment` functions from the `ggplot2` package and the `dplyr` package in #RStudio.
