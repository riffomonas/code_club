ggplot2 comes with numerous options for setting the overall appearance of a figure using its theme functions. Did you know you can create your own custom theme? In this Code Club, Pat will share how to create your own ggplot2 them by creating a theme_darkmode function and applying it to a slope plot that he has been creating in recent episodes. The data depict the percentage of people in 15 countries who would be willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as of August and October of 2020.

Pat uses the `theme` function from `ggplot2` and a variety of functions from the `dplyr`, `showtext`, and `ggtext` packages in RStudio.
