Pat critiques a figure from a paper published in the scientific journal Nature Microbiology. He discusses the context of the article including its audience, venue, and biological question before moving on to discussing how the panels within the figure are composed. Finally, he discusses the limitation of the authors' approach and some alternatives that might have aligned better with the text and been easier for the audience to interpret. By Describing, Analyzing, Interpreting, and then Judging the visual he contends that we can give a more constructive data visualization that will help the recipient and the person giving the critique get the most out of the experience.
