To acknowledge Pat's efforts to support open data science within the field of microbiome research, he received the 2022 ASM Microbiome Data Prize awarded in conjunction with the National Microbiome Data Collaboration. This was the first time the award has been given. This video includes the audio and slides from the talk he gave to receive the award at the 2022 Microbe Conference that is run by the American Society for Microbiology. This is a different format from most Code Club videos, but the content is directly related to the concepts we have discussed over the past 220 videos.
