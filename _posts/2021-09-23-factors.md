Ever wonder how to set the order of categorical variables in a figure generated in R? Factors! Changing the order of categorical values can be useful in figures when the data are ordinal or when you want to order the values by another variable. Pat will use the base R `factor` function and the forcats `fct_reorder` function. The data depict the percentage of people in 15 countries who would be willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as of August and October of 2020.

Pat uses `factor` and the `fct_reorder` function from the `forcats` package as well as functions from the `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `showtext`, `ggtext` and `glue` packages in RStudio
