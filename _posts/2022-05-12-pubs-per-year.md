Pat will show you how to search PubMed from R using the rentrez package to understand how the number of papers in a field has grown over time. He'll share two ways. First, he'll get the data directly from PubMed and import them into R. Second, he'll automate the process using the rentrez R package, which allows you to search PubMed and any NCBI database from within R. Along the way, he'll show how to analyze the data using R functions from dplyr and ggplot2 within RStudio.
