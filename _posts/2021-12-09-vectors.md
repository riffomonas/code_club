Everything in R is a vector. In this Code Club, Pat shows how to use base R functions including c, :, seq, and rep to build a vector. As a bonus, he'll show you how to access built in vectors letter, LETTERS, month.abb, and month.name. This is part of a series of videos demonstrating how to functions from base R to make these data compatible with tools from the tidyverse.
