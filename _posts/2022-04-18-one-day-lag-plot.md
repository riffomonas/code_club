An ordination has a limited set of uses. But are there alterantives to ordination for displaying beta-diversity data? In this episode, Pat shares one method for showing temporal stability in microbial communities where he looks at the day to day difference in beta diversity. He'll demonstrate this approach by using `vegan`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2`.
