Did you see that R version 4.1.0 included a pipe within base R? Perhaps you're wondering how it compares to the magrittr pipe we're familiar with from the tidyverse. Pat breaks down the relevant differences and why he's sticking with the magrittr pipe we're all familiar with. He also explores the other pipes and aliases that are available through magrittr. He does all this using local weather data downloaded from NOAA in RStudio with a lot of help from the tidyverse
