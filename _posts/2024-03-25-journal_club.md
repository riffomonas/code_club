The RDP's Naive Bayesian Classifier has been a popular tool for classifying 16S rRNA gene sequences. It has been implemented in a number of other tools. Because we are going to be building our phyloyper package around this algorithm, it is important that we understand how the algorithm works. In this episode I go through the results of the benchmarking that were presented in the paper and then move on to break down the algorithm.
