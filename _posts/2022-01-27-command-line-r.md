RStudio is the primary environment that people learn R in and work in. Are there alternatives to this iconic program? Why would you want to leave RStudio? The two primary reasons are a need to work with R in an environment where you don't have a graphical interface (e.g., on an HPC) or when you need to automate the running of your code. This Code Club will show you how you can run R from the command line and find tools to replace your favorite functionality from RStudio. This is part of a series of videos demonstrating how to functions from base R to make these data compatible with tools from the tidyverse.
