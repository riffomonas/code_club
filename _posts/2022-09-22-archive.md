The archive R package allows you to read and write tar.gz and other archive files so that you don't have to use the command line commands to do the extraction. This is convenient because they allow you to incorporate these functions into your dplyr pipelines. In this episode Pat demonstrates how to use the functions from the package and then attempts to extract 122,000 files from a large archive. The overall goal of this project is to highlight reproducible research practices using a number of tools. The specific output from this project will be a map-based visual that shows the level of drought across the globe.
