Do you have R scripts where you repeat the same chunk of code over and over? You need to learn about the DRY principle! DRY stands for Don't Repeat Yourself. Following this principle will make your code easier to manage and help you to avoid propogating errors across your project. Check out this episode to see how Pat uses the DRY principle to minimize duplication and then demonstrates how to expand his code using the DRY principle.

In this episode, Pat will use functions from the `mikropml` R package and data handling functions from `dplyr` in RStudio.

## Code

You can browse the state of the repository at the
* [beginning of the episode](https://github.com/riffomonas/mikropml_demo/tree/{{ page.start_hash }})
* [end of the episode](https://github.com/riffomonas/mikropml_demo/tree/{{ page.end_hash }})


## Installations

If you haven't been following along, you can get caught up by doing the following:

* [(windows) Install the Ubuntu Linux BASH shell for Windows 10](https://itsfoss.com/install-bash-on-windows/)
* (mac) Install `homebrew` and `git`
  ```
	/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
	brew install git
	```

* To get to where we are at the beginning of this episode (you won't have the same issue numbers at Pat)...
  - Set up a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account
  - Create a new [GitHub repository](https://github.com/new)
    - Call it "mikropml_demo"
    - Make it Public
    - Don't check the box next to "Initialize this repository with a README"
    - Click the green "Create repository" button
  - Go to your command line and enter the following replacing `<your_github_id>` with your GitHub user id

		git clone git@github.com:SchlossLab/mikropml_demo.git
		cd mikropml_demo
		git reset --hard {{ page.start_hash }}
		git remote set-url origin git@github.com:<your_github_id>/mikropml_demo.git
		git push -u origin master

  - Return to GitHub and refresh your browser.
  - Go to the `mikropml_demo` directory on your computer and double click on the `mikropml_demo.Rproj` icon. This will launch RStudio and you'll be good to go.
