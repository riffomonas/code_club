So often I tell you that if you want to follow along, you can go to a link below in the description to find a link where you can download the code I'm working on from github. But how do you do all that and is this skill more broadly useful? Yes! I'll even show you how you can get file sna directories from GitHub without knowing any git. Perhaps it will convince you why you should learn some git :) This is part of a series of videos demonstrating how to functions from base R to make these data compatible with tools from the tidyverse
