Non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) is an alternative to principle coordinates analysis (PCoA) and its relative, principle component analysis (PCA). All of these are popular ordination techniques that you can use to reduce the dimensions of data in R. In this episode, Pat Schloss will show how to perform NMDS in R and visualize the ordination in ggplot2. We'll use the metaMDS function from vegan and tools from ggplot2 and the tidyverse packages.
