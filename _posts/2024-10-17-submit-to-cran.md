At last, Pat is ready to submit the phylotypr package to CRAN. He shows how to use tooling from the devtools R package to create a checklist that uses a variety of functions to test the package before submitting it to CRAN. He then shows the result of the initial submission and responds to the automated testing. After resubmitting he responds to the feedback from the CRAN curator. Finally, he shares his excitement over having the package posted to CRAN. This episode is part of an ongoing effort to develop an R package that implements the naive Bayesian classifier for classifying 16S rRNA gene sequences.
