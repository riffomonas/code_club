Pat loves the ability to easily make jitter plots in R with tools from ggplot2. In this episode, Pat recreates his own figure from 2 years ago and then compares the code. How similar do you think the code will be? How similar would your code be after 2 years of learning and using more R? Watch as Pat uses magrittr aliases, `map_dfr`, `if_else`, `ggplot2`, `geom_jitter`, `theme`, `scale_x_log10`, `scale_color_manual`, and more. This episode is a bit different than Pat's other episodes and would love your feedback on this type of content!
