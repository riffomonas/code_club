The ability to use `dplyr`'s join functions to merge and filter data frames in R has made life so much easier than trying to do the same thing with base R. In this Code Club, Pat will demonstrate how to use and the difference between `full_join`, `inner_join`, `left_join`, `right_join`, and `anti_join`. He'll demonstrate how to use these functions with a massive data frame that we downloaded from Our World in Data that describes COVID-19 vaccination rates by country and day.
