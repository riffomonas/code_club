The number and diversity of packages in R is one of its greatest strengths. Developing these packages has always been tricky and fraught with pain. Thankfully, Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan have removed a lot of the pain with their book R Packages. We'll go through the first chapter of their book to develop an example R package before creating our own package in future episodes. We'll use a number of functions from the `devtools`, `usethis`, and `testthat` packages to develop the example R package.
