If you know you have outliers in your dataset how would you go about removing them in R? In this episode, Pat will show you how to identify outliers using graphical approaches using ggplot2 and if they are truly anomalous how to remove them using functions from dplyr. We'll do all this using local weather data from the NOAA website in RStudio
