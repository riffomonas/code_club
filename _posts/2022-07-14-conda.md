Conda and mamba are tools that allow you to create environments that you can use for R programming. By specifically defining the software and packages in your environment you can be more precise in defining the tools that you use to run your code. In this episode, Pat will introduce you to conda and mamba and will show how to install R and R pacakges from the command line and from a configuration file.
