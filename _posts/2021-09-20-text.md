Ever wonder how to change the appearance of the text in a figure generated in R? This is your video! Pat will use the labs and theme functions from ggplot2 and show you everything you'd ever want to know about formatting the titles and axis labels of your figures using element_text, element_markdown, and element_textbox_simple. The data depict the percentage of people in 15 countries who would be willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as of August and October of 2020.

Pat uses functions from the tidyverse including the `element_text`, `element_markdown`, and `element_textbox_simple` functions from the `ggplot2` and `ggtext` packages in #RStudio.
