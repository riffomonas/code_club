Whenever we see or generate a data visualization it's important that we review what does and doesn't work in the visual. In this Code Club, Pat reviews two figures he's recreated that were originally published by Ipsos into a more stylized one published by chartr. He finishes the episode with a discussion of what he plans on taking from both visualizations to create a new one.
