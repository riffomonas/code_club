Sometimes you need to create a bunch of commits to troubleshoot a problem. When you look at you log, you wish you could rewrite your commit history to make it more compact and informative. In this Code Club, Pat will show you how you can rewrite your commit history using git rebase to squash commits. The overall goal of this project is to highlight reproducible research practices using a number of tools. The specific output from this project will be a map-based visual that shows the level of drought across the globe. The website we generate in this episode can be found at https://www.riffomonas.org/drought_index.
