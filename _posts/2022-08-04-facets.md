How do you change the appearance of facet labels in the ggplot2 R package? In this episode of Code Club, Pat shows you how to change the location, appearance, and labels within facet labels when using ggplot2's `facet_wrap`. He'll also show how you can alter the order of the facets in your figure. The overall goal is to show the amount and probability of precipitation throughout the year using NOAA data from his local weather station.
