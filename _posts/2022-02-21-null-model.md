Rarefaction of ecological distances and alpha diversity metrics has become controversial in the microbial ecology field. In this Code Club, Pat will use R to look at issues that surround the controversy. Pat will generate a null community distribution model and then assess the impact of rarefaction using the vegdist and avgdist functions from the vegan R package. He'll show how to synthesize and visualize the data using tools from dplyr, ggplot2, and other tidyverse packages.
