Pat does a data viz makeover by converting a grouped bar plot to a dot plot using ggplot2 in R. He customizes the appearance using geom_point, geom_hline, scale_fill_manual, scale_y_discrete, coord_cartesian, labs, and theme functions. You can find the code he developed in this episode at https://www.riffomonas.org/code_club/2024-10-24-dotplot. The original bar plot was included in a slide deck to report the results of a study performed by Oxford University Press. You can find their press release at https://corp.oup.com/news/how-are-researchers-responding-to-ai/ and the slide deck is at https://fdslive.oup.com/www.oup.com/academic/pdf/Researchers-and-AI-survey-findings.pdf. The figure I recreate in this episode is on slide 20. The newsletter describing how I would go about generating the figure can be found at https://shop.riffomonas.org/posts/whatever-you-do-don-t-use-ai-to-figure-out-this-plot.
