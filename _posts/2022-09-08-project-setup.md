To get going on a new reproducible project we're going to talk about project organization and set up the directory with git, create a conda environment, and sync everything to GitHub. Our conda environment will start out with an installation of R and the tidyverse package. The goal of this project is to highlight reproducible research practices using a number of tools. The specific output from this project will be a map-based visual that shows the level of drought across the globe.
