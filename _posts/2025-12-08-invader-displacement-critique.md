Pat critiques a figure from a paper published in the scientific journal Nature Microbiology that did an excellent job of helping the audience interpret their data through a nice use of cartoons, edge color, fill color, and panel layout. He discusses the context of the article including its audience, venue, and biological question before moving on to discussing how the panels within the figure are composed. Finally, he discusses the limitation of the authors' approach and some alternatives that might have aligned better with the text and been easier for the audience to interpret. By Describing, Analyzing, Interpreting, and then Judging the visual he contends that we can give a more constructive data visualization that will help the recipient and the person giving the critique get the most out of the experience. You can freely access the article Pat discusses at [*Nature Microbiology*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-025-02162-w). If you have a figure that you would like to see me discuss in a future newsletter and episode of Code Club, email me at pat@riffomonas.org!
