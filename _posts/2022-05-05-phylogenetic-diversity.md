Phylogenetic diversity is an approach to quantifying alpha diversity based on a phylogenetic tree generated from sequences. But is it much different from traditional alpha diversity metrics like richness or Shannon diversity? In this Code Club, Pat will use R to quantify the difference between these metrics using the same tools. He'll answer the question using data generated with mothur and tidyverse R functions from `vegan`, `dplyr`, and `ggplot2`.
