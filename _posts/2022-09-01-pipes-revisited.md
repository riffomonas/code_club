People are talking a lot about pipes in R these days using the new base R pipes as well as the pipe provided by magrittr. Is there a keyboard shortcut to create the pipes?

Pat will address these questions using local weather data downloaded from NOAA in RStudio with a lot of help from the tidyverse and the bench R package
