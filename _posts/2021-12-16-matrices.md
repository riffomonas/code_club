A matrix in base R is vector of vectors where all of the data in the matrix is of the same type. This data structure has important uses for things like working with distance matrices, performing linear algebra, and other applications. If you understand how to work with R's vectors, working with a matrix in base R will be straightforward. This is part of a series of videos demonstrating how to functions from base R to make these data compatible with tools from the tidyverse
