For Code Club we will be exploring data collected by [Five Thirty Eight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/) to determine what factors figured in to making a candy someone's favorite. You will be able to join the conversation using [this link](https://zoom.us/j/667635601?pwd=eGdBdTFpMjdVSXgrZjRXN2dzNDRnUT09) to use Zoom. The session should last an hour. Considering this is our first session, it may go a little longer.

Shortly before the session starts I will post the code prompt here.
