Pat introduces the DAIJ model for giving a critique to a data visualization that is often used to critique art. By describing, analyzing, interpreting, and then judging the visual he contends that we can give a more constructive data visualization that will help the recipient and the person giving the critique get the most out of the experience. He uses a diverging bar plot from a Washington Post article about the US government shutdown to motivate a discussion of the model.
