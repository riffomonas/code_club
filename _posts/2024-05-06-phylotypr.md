Pat's had a change of heart on what to name our R package. We're dropping the 'e' and going with phylotypr! Aside from going through all of the steps to rename the package, we'll update RStudio and R, and do a better job of organizing our code. You'll see Pat use git both from within RStudio and within the termainal. There's a lot of great material you won't want to miss! This episode is part of an ongoing effort to develop an R package that implements the naive Bayesian classifier.
