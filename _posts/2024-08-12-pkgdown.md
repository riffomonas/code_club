The pkgdown R package makes it painless to create a website that provides documentation for your own R package that you can host for free on GitHub. In this episode, Pat shows how easy it is to build a website based on the documentation we've been writing as we've developed our package. He also shares some strategies for learning how to do new and interesting things with your own site by inspecting the code used in websites for other packages. This episode is part of an ongoing effort to develop an R package that implements the naive Bayesian classifier for classifying 16S rRNA gene sequences.
