Bash and Zsh are tremendously powerful tools for doing file operations from the command line. You can combine multiple bash programs in a script to automate your data analysis pipelines. In this Code Club, Pat uses bash scripts and a driver script to download files from a website and will share some tricks for using wget and tar within his bash scripts. The goal of this project is to highlight reproducible research practices using a number of tools. The specific output from this project will be a map-based visual that shows the level of drought across the globe.
