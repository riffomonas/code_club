Pat uses Rmarkdown to create a web page that shows the level of drought across the world and then shares how to host the page with GitHub pages for free. The overall goal of this project is to highlight reproducible research practices using a number of tools. The specific output from this project will be a map-based visual that shows the level of drought across the globe.
