If you've ever wanted to connect a new RStudio project with GitHub, this is your tutorial! Pat will show you how he uses GitHub to create a repository that can be used to start an RStudio project. He'll go through a few iterations of adding, committing, and pushing changes from RStudio back to GitHub. Finally, he'll show some examples of climate change data visualizations using ggplot2 and dplyr that he plans on recreating with this new project!
