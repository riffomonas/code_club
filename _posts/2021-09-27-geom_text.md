Adding text labels to your figure to tell your audience what group each point or line comes from. Thankfully, it's relatively easy to pull this off in R using ggplot2's geom_text function. We'll replace our legend with text annotations and talk about how we can make the labels easier to see. Along the way, we'll also learn about the modulus operator (%%) and get to see if_else and case_when in action. The data depict the percentage of people in 15 countries who would be willing to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as of August and October of 2020.

Pat uses the `geom_text` function function from `ggplot2` and a variety of functions from the `dplyr`, `showtext`, and `ggtext` packages in RStudio.
