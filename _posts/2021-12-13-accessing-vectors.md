Once you know how to create a vector in base R, you'll want to know how to access values in a vector and possibly how to remove values from a vector. Perhaps it's not a surprise to learn that you can use vectors to work with vectors. This is part of a series of videos demonstrating how to functions from base R to make these data compatible with tools from the tidyverse
