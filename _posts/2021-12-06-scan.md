The R scan function is key if you need to read in non-rectangular and any irregular shaped data. In this episode, Pat demonstrates scan's arguments to read in a lower triangular phylip-formatted distance matrix. This is part of a series of videos demonstrating how to functions from base R to make these data compatible with tools from the tidyverse

A file with the simple distance matrix can be obtained [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/riffomonas/distances/main/mice_simple.braycurtis.dist). The data were generated in our [Kozich et al. 2013 paper](http://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01043-13) using samples from the [Schloss et al. 2012 paper](http://doi.org/10.4161/gmic.21008).
