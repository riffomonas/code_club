For our next Code Club, we will continue our exploration of data collected by [Five Thirty Eight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/) that looked at how people feel about different types of candy. [In the first code club](2020-03-26-candy-crusy), we initially played with the data. Last week, we began to use the `filter` function to generate logical (or boolean) queries to identify rows from the data that met our criteria. This time we'll focus on using `filter` with quantitative data and we'll see how to use it with the `group_by` and `summarize` functions.

You will be able to join the conversation using [this link](https://zoom.us/j/96466835271?pwd=dGljcGc5clFyeVI5ZjJsdHFOQWo0UT09) to use Zoom. The session should last an hour. Please be sure to see the [setup instructions](/code_club/setup-instructions) and [code of conduct](/code_club/code-of-conduct) before we get going.
