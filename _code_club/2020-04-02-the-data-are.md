For our next Code Club, we will be exploring data collected by [Five Thirty Eight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/elitist-superfluous-or-popular-we-polled-americans-on-the-oxford-comma/) that looked at how people feel about two of the more contentious of Pat's Pedantic Points: the [oxford comma](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/946417) and whether the word ["data" is plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(band)). You will be able to join the conversation using [this link](https://zoom.us/j/667635601?pwd=eGdBdTFpMjdVSXgrZjRXN2dzNDRnUT09) to use Zoom. The session should last an hour. Please be sure to see the [setup instructions](/code_club/setup-instructions) and [code of conduct](/code_club/code-of-conduct) before we get going. You should also check out the [previous session](2020-03-26-candy-crush) where we analyzed candy data. This go around we'll spend a little more time talking about how to use `dplyr` verbs to process the data.

<!-- Prompt -->
Shortly before the session starts I will post the code prompt here.

If you are unable to participate with us live, I will post a video version of the session so you can follow along on your own.

<!-- Solution -->
At the end, I will post our solution
