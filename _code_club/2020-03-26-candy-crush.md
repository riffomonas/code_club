For our inaugural Code Club, we will be exploring data collected by [Five Thirty Eight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/the-ultimate-halloween-candy-power-ranking/) to determine what factors figure in to making a candy someone's favorite. You will be able to join the conversation using [this link](https://zoom.us/j/667635601?pwd=eGdBdTFpMjdVSXgrZjRXN2dzNDRnUT09) to use Zoom. The session should last an hour. Considering this is our first session, it may go a little longer as work out some of the kinks. Please be sure to see the [setup instructions](/code_club/setup-instructions/) and [code of conduct](/code_club/code-of-conduct/) before we get going.
