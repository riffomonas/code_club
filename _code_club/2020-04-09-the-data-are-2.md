For our next Code Club, we will continue our exploration of data collected by [Five Thirty Eight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/elitist-superfluous-or-popular-we-polled-americans-on-the-oxford-comma/) that looked at how people feel about the [oxford comma](https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/946417) and whether the word ["data" is plural](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes_(band)). [Last week](2020-04-02-the-data-are), we began to look at these data by renaming the column titles using the `rename` function and made the values in those columns easier to work with using the `recode` function. This week we will work with the `filter` function to identify rows in the data frame that satisfy certain requirements.

You will be able to join the conversation using [this link](https://zoom.us/j/593937827?pwd=ZUxNM3M4djdBVEM4VE5DKzlGZzhLZz09) to use Zoom. The session should last an hour. Please be sure to see the [setup instructions](/code_club/setup-instructions) and [code of conduct](/code_club/code-of-conduct) before we get going.
