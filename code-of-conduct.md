	<h2>Code Club Code of Conduct</h2>

	<p>The premise behind a Code Club is that we can help each other learn to be better programmers and data analysts. This requires trust on everyone's part. If a facilitator or participant breaks this trust, the goals of Code Club will be significantly hindered. All participants and facilitators of this Code Club are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Facilitators will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.</p>


	<h3>The Quick Version</h3>

	<p>Code Club is dedicated to provide a harassment-free coding experience for everyone, regardless of coding proficiency, gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for anything having to do with the Code Club. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organizers.</p>


	<h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>

	<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.</p>

	<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

	<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the facilitator may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from that and any future sessions.</p>

	<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a facilitator and/or <a href="mailto:pschloss@umich.edu">Pat Schloss</a> immediately.</p>
